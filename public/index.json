You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Math Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\n1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.

Results: A multivariate linear mixed sub-model is specified for the longitudinal outcomes, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-varying covariates is specified for the event time sub-model. The association between models is captured through a zero-mean multivariate latent Gaussian process. The models are fitted using a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximisation algorithm, and inferences are based on approximate standard errors from the empirical profile information matrix, which are contrasted to an alternative bootstrap estimation approach. We illustrate the model and software on a real data example for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis with three repeatedly measured biomarkers.

Previous research has predominantly concentrated on the joint modelling of a single longitudinal outcome and a single time-to-event outcome. In clinical practice, the data collected will often be more complex, featuring multiple longitudinal outcomes. Harnessing all available measurements in a single model is advantageous and should lead to improved and more specific model predictions. Notwithstanding the increased flexibility and better predictive capabilities, the extension of the classical univariate joint modelling framework to a multivariate setting introduces a number of technical and computational challenges. These include the high-dimensional numerical integration required, modelling of multivariate unbalanced data, and estimation of standard errors. Consequently, software capable of fitting joint models to multivariate data has been lacking. Building on recent methodological developments, we describe the extension of the classical joint model to multiple continuous longitudinal outcomes and describe how to fit it using a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Practical issues of Monte Carlo integration, convergence, and standard error estimation are discussed.

While the event is often death, giving rise to the phrase ‘survival analysis’, the event might also be, for example, a reoperation. As such, it is sometimes referred to as ‘time-to-event analysis’. Censoring sets survival analysis apart from other analyses: at the end of the follow-up period, not all subjects have experienced the event of interest, and some subjects may drop out of the study prior to completion. Survival data for a group of subjects is usually visualized by the Kaplan–Meier estimator, representing the probability of a subject remaining free of the event during follow-up. There are several methods to compare survival between the study groups, for example, treatment arms, including the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model. The log-rank test is an unadjusted non-parametric method, whereas the Cox proportional hazards model allows comparison while adjusting for multiple covariates. A principal assumption of the Cox proportional hazards model is that the relative hazard stays constant over time—the so-called proportionality. Specific methods exist for comparison of survival with the general population. This article describes the fundamental concepts every cardiothoracic surgeon should be aware of when analysing survival data and are illustrated with a clinical example.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical primer: performing repeated-measures analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519171200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519171200,"objectID":"ac9606bee7272abae76d892f3d244984","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2018_liverpool/","publishdate":"2018-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2018_liverpool/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A comparison of joint models for longitudinal and competing risks data, with application to an epilepsy drug randomized controlled trial","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hickey GL","Philipson P","Jorgensen A","Kolamunnage-Dona R"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"3919990347f900f38c1097d088afff5e","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2018-multivariate/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2018-multivariate/","section":"publication","summary":"Methodological development and clinical application of joint models of longitudinal and time-to-event outcomes have grown substantially over the past two decades.

We comprehensively review the literature for implementation of joint models involving more than a single event time per subject.

Despite the recent methodological developments, there are still limited options for fitting these models in standard statistical software programs, which prohibits their adoption by applied biostatisticians. We summarize four published models, each of which has software available for model estimation. Each model features a different hazard function, latent association structure between the submodels, estimation approach and software implementation. Of the four models considered here, the model specifications and association structures are substantially different, thus complicating model-to-model comparison. The models are applied to the ‘Standard and new anti-epileptic drugs’ trial of anti-epileptic drugs to investigate the effect of drug titration on the treatment effects of lamotrigine and carbamazepine on the mode of treatment failure. Notwithstanding the vastly different association structures, we show that the inference from each model is consistent, namely, that there is a beneficial effect of lamotrigine on unacceptable adverse events over carbamazepine and a non-significant effect on the hazard of inadequate seizure control. The association between anti-epileptic drug titration and treatment failure was significant in most models. To allow for the routine adoption of joint modelling of competing risks and longitudinal data in the analysis of clinical data sets, further work is required on the development of model diagnostics to aid model choice.","tags":null,"title":"A comparison of joint models for longitudinal and competing risks data, with application to an epilepsy drug randomized controlled trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512864000,"objectID":"1cd022a67746b21a1d775bf34a0362c0","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_cms/","publishdate":"2017-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_cms/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic survival prediction for multivariate joint models using the R package joineRML","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510531200,"objectID":"a92172026d707fb40a0ab6db8e62c950","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_durham/","publishdate":"2017-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_durham/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Joint modelling of multivariate longitudinal and time-to-event data","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1508976000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508976000,"objectID":"35bff66e36b2eb1cac9133f0e77e5452","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-fundamentals/","publishdate":"2017-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-fundamentals/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"What you need to know about statistics to read a journal article","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507593600,"objectID":"888370158f14bb4db665995732039058","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-4/","publishdate":"2017-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-4/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Checking model assumptions with regression diagnostics","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507507200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507507200,"objectID":"86484fb499105a8eee436cdbc182516b","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-3/","publishdate":"2017-10-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-3/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Performing repeated measure analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507507200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507507200,"objectID":"c2eb33d0d368e2ebacd93109b0230df2","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-2/","publishdate":"2017-10-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-2/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sample size determination: why, when, how?","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507420800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507420800,"objectID":"c008e260bb989409ce220fb411987960","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-1/","publishdate":"2017-10-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2017_eacts-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"To inform or confuse with Tables and Figures: the EJCTS experience","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Bashir M","Harky A","Fok M","Shaw MA","Hickey GL","Grant SW","Uppal R","Oo AY"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501545600,"objectID":"447199a455c44b1e88db9afa209f10a6","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2017-aortic/","publishdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2017-aortic/","section":"publication","summary":"Objectives: Surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (ATAD) carries a high risk of operative mortality.

Over 200 human proteins were differentially expressed in each cohort, of which 65% were common to both. Proteins involved in the immune response and exosome signalling were significantly enriched in the infected samples. For a subset of proteins derived from the proteome analysis, we corroborated the proteomics data in a third cohort (hospital controls (n=15), healthy controls (n=5), cases (n=20)) by automated quantitative western blotting, with excellent agreement with our proteomics findings.

Design: A microsimulation study of a close-to-reality synthetic population. In the first period, 2003–2015, we compared the impact of current policy against a counterfactual ‘no intervention’ scenario, which assumed salt consumption persisted at 2003 levels. For 2016–2030, we assumed additional legislative policies could achieve a steeper salt decline and we compared this against the counterfactual scenario that the downward trend in salt consumption observed between 2001 and 2011 would continue up to 2030. Setting: Synthetic population with similar characteristics to the non-institutionalised population of England. Participants: Synthetic individuals with traits informed by the Health Survey for England. Main measure: CVD and GCa cases and deaths prevented or postponed, stratified by fifths of socioeconomic status using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Results: Since 2003, current salt policies have prevented or postponed ∼52,000 CVD cases (IQR: 34,000–76,000) and 10,000 CVD deaths (IQR: 3000–17,000). In addition, the current policies have prevented ∼5000 new cases of GCa (IQR: 2000–7000) resulting in about 2000 fewer deaths (IQR: 0–4000). This policy did not reduce socioeconomic inequalities in CVD, and likely increased inequalities in GCa. Additional legislative policies from 2016 could further prevent or postpone ∼19,000 CVD cases (IQR: 8000–30,000) and 3600 deaths by 2030 (IQR: −400–8100) and may reduce inequalities. Similarly for GCa, 1200 cases (IQR: −200–3000) and 700 deaths (IQR: −900–2300) could be prevented or postponed with a neutral impact on inequalities. Conclusions: Current salt reduction policies are powerfully effective in reducing the CVD and GCa burdens overall but fail to reduce the inequalities involved. Additional structural policies could achieve further, more equitable health benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Estimated reductions in cardiovascular and gastric cancer disease burden through salt policies: an IMPACT NCD microsimulation study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hickey GL","Bridgewater B","Grant SW","Deanfield J","Parkinson J","Bryan AJ","Dalrymple-Hay M","Moat NE","Buchan I","Dunning J"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6bdf4ed182ef0d18c4576a2f5c4bdca2","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2017-avr-models/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2017-avr-models/","section":"publication","summary":"Importance: Postmarket evidence generation for medical devices is important yet limited for prosthetic aortic valve devices in the United Kingdom. Objective: To identify prosthetic aortic valve models that display unexpected patterns of mortality or reintervention using routinely collected national registry data and record linkage. Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational study used data from all National Health Service and private hospitals in England and Wales that submit data to the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit (NACSA). All patients undergoing first-time elective and urgent aortic valve replacement surgery (with or without coronary artery bypass grafting) with a biological (n = 15 series) or mechanical (n = 10 series) prosthetic valve from 5 primary suppliers, and satisfying prespecified data quality criteria (n = 43,782 biological; n = 11,084 mechanical) between 1998 and 2013 were included. Valves were classified into series of related models. Outcome tracking was performed using multifaceted record linkage. The median follow-up was 4.1 years (maximum, 15.3 years). Cox proportional hazards regression with random effects (frailty models) were used to model valve effects on the outcomes, with and without adjustment for preoperative and intraoperative covariates. Main Outcomes and Measures: Time to all-cause mortality or aortic valve reintervention (surgical or transcatheter). There were 13,104 deaths and 723 reinterventions during follow-up. Results: Of 79,345 isolated aortic valve replacement procedures with or without coronary artery bypass grafting, 54,866 were analyzed. Biological valve implantation rates increased from 59% in 1998 and 1999 to 86% in 2012 and 2013. Two series of valves associated with significantly increased hazard of death or reintervention were identified (first series: frailty, 1.18; 95% prediction interval [PI], 1.06-1.32 and second series: frailty, 1.19; 95% PI, 1.09-1.31). These results were robust to covariate adjustment and sensitivity analyses. There were 3 prosthetic valves with a significant reduction in hazard (valve 1: frailty, 0.88; 95% PI, 0.80-0.96; valve 2: frailty, 0.88; 95% PI, 0.80-0.96; and valve 3: frailty, 0.88; 95% PI, 0.78-0.98).

In practice, clinical studies are likely to record multiple longitudinal outcomes. Incorporating all sources of data will improve the predictive capability of any model and lead to more informative inferences for the purpose of medical decision-making. Methods: We reviewed current methodologies of joint modelling for time-to-event data and multivariate longitudinal data including the distributional and modelling assumptions, the association structures, estimation approaches, software tools for implementation and clinical applications of the methodologies. Results: We found that a large number of different models have recently been proposed. Most considered jointly modelling linear mixed models with proportional hazard models, with correlation between multiple longitudinal outcomes accounted for through multivariate normally distributed random effects. So-called current value and random effects parameterisations are commonly used to link the models. Despite developments, software is still lacking, which has translated into limited uptake by medical researchers. Conclusion: Although, in an era of personalized medicine, the value of multivariate joint modelling has been established, researchers are currently limited in their ability to fit these models routinely. We make a series of recommendations for future research needs.","tags":null,"title":"Joint modelling of time-to-event and multivariate longitudinal outcomes: recent developments and issues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Su T-L","Jaki T","Hickey GL","Buchan I","Sperrin M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1469491200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1469491200,"objectID":"60d3126b8dfaeb5a38d87ac0474a0ff4","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2016-cpm-update/","publishdate":"2016-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2016-cpm-update/","section":"publication","summary":"A clinical prediction model is a tool for predicting healthcare outcomes, usually within a specific population and context. A common approach is to develop a new clinical prediction model for each population and context; however, this wastes potentially useful historical information. A better approach is to update or incorporate the existing clinical prediction models already developed for use in similar contexts or populations. In addition, clinical prediction models commonly become miscalibrated over time, and need replacing or updating. In this article, we review a range of approaches for re-using and updating clinical prediction models; these fall in into three main categories: simple coefficient updating, combining multiple previous clinical prediction models in a meta-model and dynamic updating of models. We evaluated the performance (discrimination and calibration) of the different strategies using data on mortality following cardiac surgery in the United Kingdom: We found that no single strategy performed sufficiently well to be used to the exclusion of the others. In conclusion, useful tools exist for updating existing clinical prediction models to a new population or context, and these should be implemented rather than developing a new clinical prediction model from scratch, using a breadth of complementary statistical methods.","tags":null,"title":"A review of statistical updating methods for clinical prediction models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kypridemos C","Allen K","Hickey GL","Bandosz P","Guzman-Castillo M","Buchan I","Capewell S","O’Flaherty M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1465344000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465344000,"objectID":"db42b08c0725a3ffcda7ad3bec05e011","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2016-impact-screen/","publishdate":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2016-impact-screen/","section":"publication","summary":"Objectives: To estimate the potential impact of universal screening for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (National Health Service Health Checks) on disease burden and socioeconomic inequalities in health in England, and to compare universal screening with alternative feasible strategies. Design: Microsimulation study of a close-to-reality synthetic population. Five scenarios were considered: baseline scenario, assuming that current trends in risk factors will continue in the future; universal screening; screening concentrated only in the most deprived areas; structural population-wide intervention; and combination of population-wide intervention and concentrated screening. Setting: Synthetic population with similar characteristics to the community dwelling population of England. Participants: Synthetic people with traits informed by the health survey for England. Main outcome measure: Cardiovascular disease cases and deaths prevented or postponed by 2030, stratified by fifths of socioeconomic status using the index of multiple deprivation. Results: Compared with the baseline scenario, universal screening may prevent or postpone approximately 19.000 cases (interquartile range 11,000-28,000) and 3000 deaths (−1000-6000); concentrated screening 17,000 cases (9000-26.000) and 2000 deaths (−1000-5000); population-wide intervention 67,000 cases (57,000-77,000) and 8000 deaths (4000-11,000); and the combination of the population-wide intervention and concentrated screening 82,000 cases (73,000-93,000) and 9000 deaths (6000-13,000). The most equitable strategy would be the combination of the population-wide intervention and concentrated screening, followed by concentrated screening alone and the population-wide intervention. Universal screening had the least apparent impact on socioeconomic inequalities in health. Conclusions: When primary prevention strategies for reducing cardiovascular disease burden and inequalities are compared, universal screening seems less effective than alternative strategies, which incorporate population-wide approaches.

METHODS: Data from the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit registry for all elective and urgent isolated CABG procedures performed between April 2003 and March 2013 in first-time cardiac surgery patients were extracted. Experienced surgeons (those with ≥300 records) were classified by their technique preference (as 'off-pump preference', 'mixed practice', 'on-pump preference') based on their entire isolated CABG data. In-hospital mortality and time to death were analysed using logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models, respectively. RESULTS: From a total of 3402 records, 65.5% were performed off-pump. There were 16 (0.47%) in-hospital deaths: 6 (0.51%) in the on-pump group and 10 (0.45%) in the off-pump group. The risk-adjusted odds ratio of in-hospital mortality in the direction of on-pump was 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39-3.04; P = 0.86].

The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in the direction of on-pump CABG was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.89-1.49; P = 0.28). Comparing off-pump cases performed by experienced CABG surgeons with a preference for the off-pump technique with on-pump cases performed by surgeons with a preference for the on-pump technique indicated a significant difference (HR for on-pump = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.19-2.47; P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Elective and urgent first-time CABG for isolated LAD disease is associated with excellent mid-term survival in the England and Wales population, conferring a 5-year survival rate of 93.1 and 93.4% in the on-pump and off-pump groups, respectively. There was no difference in risk-adjusted survival between the on-pump and off-pump techniques when analysing all procedures; however, supportive analysis demonstrated that off-pump surgery performed by experienced surgeons with a preference for the off-pump technique in their CABG caseload is associated with improved mid-term survival when compared with on-pump surgery performed by surgeons with a preference for the on-pump technique.","tags":null,"title":"A comparison of survival between on-pump and off-pump left internal mammary artery bypass graft surgery for isolated left anterior descending coronary artery disease: an analysis of the UK National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit Registry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bashir M","Shaw MA","Grayson AD","Fok M","Hickey GL","Grant SW","Bridgewater B","Oo AY"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"dc35a9bc092ba686b7e73e1b0b048eb7","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2016-aortic/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2016-aortic/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: To facilitate patient choice and the risk adjustment of consultant outcomes in aortic operations, reliable predictive tools are required.

This study presents the subsequent national activity and outcomes for both TAVI and aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS: Data for all AVR and TAVI procedures between January 2006 and December 2012 in England and Wales were included. The number of procedures, patient characteristics, in-hospital and 30-day mortality, postoperative length of stay (PLOS) and survival were analysed separately for: isolated AVR; AVR + coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery; AVR + other surgery and TAVI. RESULTS: The number of TAVIs increased from 66 in 2007 (0.8% of all implants) to 1186 in 2012 (10.9% of all implants). AVR activity also increased over the study period. TAVI patients were older and had a higher mean logistic EuroSCORE than all AVR groups. The 30-day mortality rates were 2.1% for isolated AVR, 3.9% for AVR + CABG, 7.7% for AVR + other surgery and 6.2% for TAVI. In-hospital mortality has significantly improved for all groups. The 5-year survival rates were 82.6% for isolated AVR, 81.7% for AVR + CABG, 74.5% for AVR + other surgery and 46.1% for TAVI. The median PLOS after TAVI was similar to that of isolated AVR but shorter than that of the other AVR groups. CONCLUSIONS: Since the introduction of TAVI, there has been an increase in both TAVI and AVR activity. TAVIs now represent over 10% of all aortic valve implants. There are distinct differences between procedural groups with respect to patient risk factors. Outcomes for all procedural groups have improved, but long-term TAVI results are required before its role in the treatment of aortic stenosis can be fully defined.","tags":null,"title":"Activity and outcomes for aortic valve implantations performed in England and Wales since the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Attia R","Hickey GL","Grant SW","Bridgewater B","Roxburgh J","Kumar P","Ridley P","Bhabra M","Millner R","Athanasiou T","Casula R","Chukwuemka A","Pillay T","Young C"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"9bfde89c2908b536cf64c0515ef26139","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2016-miavr/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2016-miavr/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) has been demonstrated as a safe and effective option but remains underused. We aimed to evaluate outcomes of isolated MIAVR compared with conventional aortic valve replacement (CAVR). METHODS: Data from The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) were analyzed at seven volunteer centers (2006-2012). Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and midterm survival. Secondary outcomes were postoperative length of stay as well as cumulative bypass and cross-clamp times. Propensity modeling with matched cohort analysis was used. RESULTS: Of 307 consecutive MIAVR patients, 151 (49%) were performed during the last 2 years of study with a continued increase in numbers. The 307 MIAVR patients were matched on a 1:1 ratio. In the matched CAVR group, there was no statistically significant difference in in-hospital mortality [MIAVR, 4/307,(1.3%); 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4%-3.4% vs CAVR, 6/307 (2.0%); 95% CI, 0.8%-4.3%; P = 0.752]. One-year survival rates in the MIAVR and CAVR groups were 94.4% and 94.6%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in midterm survival (P = 0.677; hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.56-1.46). Median postoperative length of stay was lower in the MIAVR patients by 1 day (P = 0.009). The mean cumulative bypass time (94.8 vs 91.3 minutes; P = 0.333) and cross-clamp time (74.6 vs 68.4 minutes; P = 0.006) were longer in the MIAVR group; however, this was significant only in the cross-clamp time comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement is a safe alternative to CAVR with respect to operative and 1-year mortality and is associated with a shorter postoperative stay. Further studies are required in high-risk (logistic EuroSCORE  10) patients to define the role of MIAVR.","tags":null,"title":"Minimally invasive versus conventional aortic valve replacement: A propensity matched study from the UK national data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448496000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448496000,"objectID":"598a91e66bc9d0741b9bc6393409e616","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2015_mhra/","publishdate":"2015-11-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2015_mhra/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Post-market surveillance of prosthetic aortic valves using registry data and record linkage","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1444089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444089600,"objectID":"76d7778a0a2ee7c9654377546dab71b0","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2015_eacts/","publishdate":"2015-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2015_eacts/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Statistical data and reporting guidelines: Important to get your paper published","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Kypridemos C","Bandosz P","Hickey G","Guzman-Castillo M","Allen K","Buchan I","Capewell S","O’Flaherty M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1440979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1440979200,"objectID":"e98c9870792735ffbd8d56aabe497901","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2015-absract-impact/","publishdate":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2015-absract-impact/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"OP04 Quantifying the contribution of statins to the decline in population mean cholesterol by socioeconomic group in England 1991–2012: a modelling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hickey GL","Dunning J","Seifert B","Sodeck G","Carr MJ","Burger HU","Beyersdorf F"],"categories":null,"content":" Corrigendum, 2016; 49(3): 1024.\n","date":1438387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438387200,"objectID":"86f35da4a899ccbd6927fee4239d96a8","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2015-ejcts/","publishdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2015-ejcts/","section":"publication","summary":"As part of the peer review process for the European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EJCTS) and the Interactive CardioVascular and Thoracic Surgery (ICVTS), a statistician reviews any manuscript that includes a statistical analysis.

Notably, the intercept coefficient has been steadily decreasing over the study period consistent with decreasing observed mortality. Some risk factors such as operative urgency and post infarct ventricular septal defect have been relatively stable overtime, whilst others such as left ventricular dysfunction and surgery on the thoracic aorta have been associated with lower risk relative to the static model.

The objective was to investigate geographical variations in social deprivation of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and identify whether social deprivation is an independent predictor of outcomes. Methods: National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit data for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or valve surgery performed in England between April 2003 and March 2013, were analysed. Base hospitals in England were divided into geographical regions. Social deprivation was measured by quintile groups of the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) score with the first quintile group (Q1) being the least, and the last quintile group (Q5) the most deprived group. In-hospital mortality and midterm survival were analysed using mixed effects logistic, and stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models respectively.Results: 240,221 operations were analysed. There was substantial regional variation in social deprivation with the proportion of patients in IMD Q5 ranging from 34.5% in the North East to 6.5% in the East of England. Following adjustment for preoperative risk factors, patients undergoing all cardiac surgery in IMD Q5 were found to have an increased risk of in-hospital mortality relative to IMD Q1 (OR=1.13; 95%CI 1.03 to 1.24), as were patients undergoing isolated CABG (OR=1.19; 95%CI 1.03 to 1.37). For midterm survival, patients in IMD Q5 had an increased hazard in all groups (HRs ranged between 1.10 (valve+CABG) and 1.26 (isolated CABG)). For isolated CABG, the median postoperative length of stay was 6 and 7-days, respectively, for IMD Q1–Q4 and Q5. Conclusions: Significant regional variation exists in the social deprivation of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in England. Social deprivation is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and reduced midterm survival. These findings have implications for health service provision, risk prediction models and analyses of surgical outcomes.","tags":null,"title":"Is social deprivation an independent predictor of outcomes following cardiac surgery?

The aim of this study was to compare performance of porcine and bovine pericardial valves implanted in AVR surgery with respect to survival and reintervention-free survival in a retrospective observational study. METHODS: Prospectively collected clinical data for all first-time elective and urgent AVRs with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery performed in England and Wales between April 2003 and March 2013 were extracted from the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research database. Patient life status was tracked from the Office for National Statistics. Time-to-event analyses were performed using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards regression modelling with random effects/grouped frailty for responsible cardiac surgeons. RESULTS: A total of 38,040 patients were included (64.9% bovine pericardial; 35.1% porcine). Patient characteristics were similar between the groups. The median follow-up was 3.6 years. There was no statistically significant difference in survival (P = 0.767) (the 10-year survival rates were 49.0 and 50.3% in the bovine pericardial and porcine groups, respectively) or reintervention-free survival. The adjusted hazard ratio for porcine valves was 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.93-1.03). Sensitivity analysis in small valve sizes showed no difference in reintervention-free survival. After adjustment, there was some evidence of a protective effect for porcine valves in relatively younger patients (P = 0.075).

Cattle are the principle reservoir of verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC O157), an important cause of disease in humans. To date there has been little empirical research on the interaction between F. hepatica and VTEC O157. It is hypothesised that F. hepatica, which is known to suppress type 1 immune responses and induce an anti-inflammatory or regulatory immune environment in the host, may promote colonisation of the bovine intestine with VTEC O157. Here we assess whether it is statistically feasible to augment a prospective study to quantify the prevalence of VTEC O157 in cattle in Great Britain with a pilot study to test this hypothesis. We simulate data under the framework of a mixed-effects logistic regression model in order to calculate the power to detect an association effect size (odds ratio) of 2.

T. gondii is capable of invading immune cells and it has been suggested that the parasite harnesses the migratory pathways of these cells to spread through the body. Although in vitro evidence suggests that the parasite further enhances its spread by inducing a hypermotility phenotype in parasitized immune cells, in vivo evidence for this phenomenon is scarce. Here we use a physiologically relevant oral model of T. gondii infection, in conjunction with two-photon laser scanning microscopy, to address this issue. We found that a small proportion of natural killer (NK) cells in mesenteric lymph nodes contained parasites. Compared with uninfected 'bystander' NK cells, these infected NK cells showed faster, more directed and more persistent migratory behavior. Consistent with this, infected NK cells showed impaired spreading and clustering of the integrin, LFA-1, when exposed to plated ligands. Our results provide the first evidence for a hypermigratory phenotype in T. gondii-infected NK cells in vivo, providing an anatomical context for understanding how the parasite manipulates immune cell motility to spread through the host.","tags":null,"title":"Toxoplasma *gondii*-infected natural killer cells display a hypermotility phenotype in vivo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kypridemos C","Bandosz P","Hickey GL","Guzman-Castillo M","Allen K","Buchan I","Capewell S","O’Flaherty M"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1427846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1427846400,"objectID":"6924fa0b3e10990e03de4aac32bcc6ea","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2015-impact/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2015-impact/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Serum total cholesterol is one of the major targets for cardiovascular disease prevention. Statins are effective for cholesterol control in individual patients. At the population level, however, their contribution to total cholesterol decline remains unclear. The aim of this study was to quantify the contribution of statins to the observed fall in population mean cholesterol levels in England over the past two decades, and explore any differences between socioeconomic groups. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a modelling study based on data from the Health Survey for England. We analysed changes in observed mean total cholesterol levels in the adult England population between 1991-92 (baseline) and 2011-12. We then compared the observed changes with a counterfactual 'no statins' scenario, where the impact of statins on population total cholesterol was estimated and removed. We estimated uncertainty intervals (UI) using Monte Carlo simulation, where confidence intervals (CI) were impractical. In 2011-12, 13.2% (95% CI: 12.5-14.0%) of the English adult population used statins at least once per week, compared with 1991-92 when the proportion was just 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3-1.0%). Between 1991-92 and 2011-12, mean total cholesterol declined from 5.86 mmol/L (95% CI: 5.82-5.90) to 5.17 mmol/L (95% CI: 5.14-5.20). For 2011-12, mean total cholesterol was lower in more deprived groups. In our 'no statins' scenario we predicted a mean total cholesterol of 5.36 mmol/L (95% CI: 5.33-5.40) for 2011-12. Statins were responsible for approximately 33.7% (95% UI: 28.9-38.8%) of the total cholesterol reduction since 1991-92. The statin contribution to cholesterol reduction was greater among the more deprived groups of women, while showing little socio-economic gradient among men. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that statins explained around a third of the substantial falls in total cholesterol observed in England since 1991. Approximately two thirds of the cholesterol decrease can reasonably be attributed non-pharmacological determinants.","tags":null,"title":"Quantifying the contribution of statins to the decline in population mean cholesterol by socioeconomic group in England 1991-2012","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Grant SW","Hickey GL","Wisely NA","Carlson ED","Hartley RA","Pichel AC","Atkinson D","McCollum CN"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425168000,"objectID":"ead55c3c589eecdfeba9469473be725c","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2015-vascular/","publishdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2015-vascular/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is increasingly used in the preoperative assessment of patients undergoing major surgery. The objective of this study was to investigate whether CPET can identify patients at risk of reduced survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from consecutive patients who underwent CPET before elective open or endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) at two tertiary vascular centres between January 2007 and October 2012 were analysed. A symptom-limited maximal CPET was performed on each patient. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modelling was used to identify risk factors associated with reduced survival. RESULTS: The study included 506 patients with a mean age of 73.4 (range 44-90). The majority (82.6%) were men and most (64.6%) underwent EVAR. The in-hospital mortality was 2.6%. The median follow-up was 26 months. The 3-year survival for patients with zero or one sub-threshold CPET value ([Formula: see text] at AT42) was 86.4% compared with 59.9% for patients with three sub-threshold CPET values. Risk factors independently associated with survival were female sex [hazard ratio (HR)=0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.85, P=0.015], diabetes (HR=1.95, 95% CI 1.04-3.69, P=0.039), preoperative statins (HR=0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.90, P=0.016), haemoglobin g dl(-1) (HR=0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.95, P=0.006), peak [Formula: see text]42 (HR=1.68, 95% CI 1.00-2.80, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: CPET variables are independent predictors of reduced survival after elective AAA repair and can identify a cohort of patients with reduced survival at 3 years post-procedure.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected national registry data over a 10-year period using mixed-effects multiple logistic regression modelling. Surgeon experience was defined as the time between the date of surgery and award of primary clinical qualification. SETTING: UK National Health Service hospitals performing cardiac surgery between January 2003 and December 2012. PARTICIPANTS: All patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafts and/or valve surgery under the care of a consultant cardiac surgeon. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 292,973 operations performed by 273 consultant surgeons (with lengths of service from 11.2 to 42.0 years) were included. Crude mortality increased approximately linearly until 33 years service, before decreasing. After adjusting for case-mix and year of surgery, there remained a statistically significant (p=0.002) association between length of service and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.013; 95% CI 1.005-1.021 for each year of 'experience'). CONCLUSIONS: Consultant cardiac surgeons take on increasingly complex surgery as they gain experience. With this progression, the incidence of adverse outcomes is expected to increase, as is demonstrated in this study. After adjusting for case-mix using the EuroSCORE, we observed an increased risk of mortality in patients operated on by longer serving surgeons. This finding may reflect under-adjustment for risk, unmeasured confounding or a real association.

Before a model is used either in clinical practice or to risk-adjust surgical outcome data it is important that its performance is assessed in external validation studies. METHODS: The British Aneurysm Repair (BAR) score, Medicare, and Vascular Governance North West (VGNW) models were validated using an independent prospectively collected sample of multicentre clinical audit data. Consecutive, data on 1,124 patients undergoing elective AAA repair at 17 hospitals in the north-west of England and Wales between April 2011 and March 2013 were analysed. The outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Model calibration (observed to expected ratio with chi-square test, calibration plots, calibration intercept and slope) and discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) were assessed in the overall cohort and procedural subgroups. RESULTS: The mean age of the population was 74.4 years (SD 7.7); 193 (17.2%) patients were women and the majority of patients (759, 67.5%) underwent endovascular aneurysm repair. All three models demonstrated good calibration in the overall cohort and procedural subgroups. Overall discrimination was excellent for the BAR score (AUC 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-0.89), and acceptable for the Medicare and VGNW models, with AUCs of 0.78 (95% CI 0.70-0.86) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.84) respectively. Only the BAR score demonstrated good discrimination in procedural subgroups. CONCLUSION: All three models demonstrated good calibration and discrimination for the prediction of in-hospital mortality following elective AAA repair and are potentially useful. The BAR score has a number of advantages, which include being developed on the most contemporaneous data, excellent overall discrimination, and good performance in procedural subgroups. Regular model validations and recalibration will be essential.","tags":null,"title":"Comparison of three contemporary risk scores for mortality following elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dimarakis I","Grant SW","Hickey GL","Patel R","Livesey S","Moat N","Wells F","Bridgewater B"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393632000,"objectID":"e65c45421aa33494172a9e6dc61cb873","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2014-mvr/","publishdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2014-mvr/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines recommend that most patients aged ≥65 years should undergo mitral valve replacement (MVR) using a biological prosthesis. The objectives of this study were to assess whether these guidelines are being followed in UK practice, and to investigate whether the guidelines are appropriate based on in-hospital mortality and mid-term survival. METHODS: Data from the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit database from all National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and some private hospitals performing adult cardiac surgery in the UK between April 2001 and March 2011 were analysed. The overall cohort included 3862 patients aged ≥65 years who underwent first-time MVR. Propensity score matching and regression adjustment were used to compare outcomes between prosthesis groups. RESULTS: The mean age was 73.0 years (SD 4.9) with 50% of patients having surgery with a mechanical prosthesis. This proportion decreased over the study period and with increasing patient age with marked variation between hospitals. In the propensity-matched cohort, in-hospital mortality in the biological group was 6.9%, and in the mechanical group it was 5.9% giving an unadjusted OR of 1.17 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.63). There was no significant difference in mid-term survival between the matched groups with an unadjusted HR for biological prosthesis of 1.08 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.24). Similar results were found when using regression adjustment on unmatched data.

We compare different model fitting approaches for in-hospital mortality after cardiac surgery that adjust for cross-sectional case mix in a heterogeneous patient population. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 300 000 consecutive cardiac surgery procedures performed at all National Health Service and some private hospitals in England and Wales between April 2001 and March 2011 were extracted from the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research clinical registry. The study outcome was in-hospital mortality. Model approaches included not updating, periodic refitting, rolling window, and dynamic logistic regression. Covariate adjustment was made in each model using variables included in the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation model. The association between in-hospital mortality and some variables changed with time. Notably, the intercept coefficient has been steadily decreasing during the study period, consistent with decreasing observed mortality. Some risk factors, such as operative urgency and postinfarct ventricular septal defect, have been relatively stable over time, whereas other risk factors, such as left ventricular function and surgery on the thoracic aorta, have been associated with lower risk relative to the static model. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic models or periodic model refitting is necessary to counteract calibration drift. A dynamic modeling framework that uses contemporary and available historic data can provide a continuously smooth update mechanism that also allows for inferences to be made on individual risk factors. Better models that withstand the effects of time give advantages for governance, quality improvement, and patient-level decision making.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic prediction modeling approaches for cardiac surgery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hickey GL","Grant SW","Bridgewater B"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1382400000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1382400000,"objectID":"82b82fd99dc4b3f42181ac4f386d1909","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2013-letter-euroscore/","publishdate":"2013-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2013-letter-euroscore/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Validation of the EuroSCORE II: should we be concerned with retrospective performance?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380758400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380758400,"objectID":"0a33f9527ecb36250d7ce65490612895","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2013_bhvs/","publishdate":"2013-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2013_bhvs/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The UKHVR web app","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hickey GL","Grant SW","Cosgriff R","Dimarakis I","Pagano D","Kappetein AP","Bridgewater B"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380585600,"objectID":"6df80b8899260af9385b26137eb95338","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2013-registry/","publishdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2013-registry/","section":"publication","summary":"Clinical registries will have an increasingly important role to play in health-care, with a number already established in cardiac surgery.

Poor model calibration has important implications for clinical decision-making and risk adjustment of governance analyses. The objective of this study was to explore the reasons for the calibration drift of the logistic EuroSCORE. METHODS: Data from the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland database were analysed for procedures performed at all National Health Service and some private hospitals in England and Wales between April 2001 and March 2011. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. EuroSCORE risk factors, overall model calibration and discrimination were assessed over time. RESULTS: A total of 317 292 procedures were included. Over the study period, mean age at surgery increased from 64.6 to 67.2 years. The proportion of procedures that were isolated coronary artery bypass grafts decreased from 67.5 to 51.2%. In-hospital mortality fell from 4.1 to 2.8%, but the mean logistic EuroSCORE increased from 5.6 to 7.6%. The logistic EuroSCORE remained a good discriminant throughout the study period (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve between 0.79 and 0.85), but calibration (observed-to-expected mortality ratio) fell from 0.76 to 0.37. Inadequate adjustment for decreasing baseline risk affected calibration considerably. DISCUSSIONS: Patient risk factors and case-mix in adult cardiac surgery change dynamically over time. Models like the EuroSCORE that are developed using a ‘snapshot’ of data in time do not account for this and can subsequently lose calibration.

These mortality results are not currently risk-adjusted. The objective of this study was to develop a national risk prediction model for elective AAA repair. METHODS: Data for consecutive patients undergoing elective AAA repair from the National Vascular Database between April 2008 and March 2011 were analysed. Multiple logistic regression and backwards model selection were used for model development. The study outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Model calibration and discrimination were assessed for all AAA repairs, and separately for open repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) subgroups. RESULTS: There were 312 in-hospital deaths among 11,423 AAA repairs (2.7 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 2.4 to 3.0) per cent): 230 after 4940 open AAA repairs (4.7 (4.1 to 5.3) per cent) and 82 after 6483 EVARs (1.3 (1.0 to 1.6) per cent). Variables associated with in-hospital death included in the final model were: open repair, increasing age, female sex, serum creatinine level over 120 µmol/l, cardiac disease, abnormal electrocardiogram, previous aortic surgery or stent, abnormal white cell count, abnormal serum sodium level, AAA diameter and American Society of Anesthesiologists fitness grade. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.781 (95 per cent c.i. 0.756 to 0.806) with a bias-corrected value of 0.774. Model calibration was good (P = 0.963) based on the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, (bias-corrected) calibration curves, risk group assessment and recalibration regression.

In cardiac surgery, emergency patients are potentially at greatest risk of inappropriate risk-averse clinical decisions. UK cardiac surgery outcomes are currently risk-adjusted with EuroSCORE models. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of the EuroSCORE models in emergency cardiac surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research database was used to identify adult cardiac surgery procedures performed in the United Kingdom between April 2008 and March 2011. A subset of procedures (July 2010-March 2011) was used for EuroSCORE II validation. The outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Model calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, calibration plots, calculation of calibration intercept and slope) and discrimination (area under receiver-operating characteristic curve [area under the curve]) were assessed. In total, 109 988 cardiac procedures at 41 hospitals were included, of which 3342 were defined as emergency procedures. Compared with performance in all cardiac surgery and nonemergency cardiac surgery, the logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II models had poorer discrimination (area under the curve, 0.703 and 0.690, respectively) and poorer calibration for emergency surgery. The EuroSCORE risk factors of female sex, chronic pulmonary disease, neurological disease, active endocarditis, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, and pulmonary hypertension were not identified as important risk factors for emergency cardiac surgery.

The aim of this study was to assess whether preoperative CPET identifies patients at risk of early death following elective open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Methods: Prospective data were collected from a pilot study between September 2005 and February 2007, and from all patients who underwent CPET before elective AAA repair at two vascular centres between February 2007 and November 2011. Symptom-limited, maximal CPET was performed on each patient. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to identify risk factors for 30- and 90-day mortality. Results: Some 415 patients underwent CPET before elective AAA repair. Anaerobic threshold (AT), peak oxygen consumption (peak V̇O2) and ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide were associated with 30- and 90-day mortality on univariable analysis. On multivariable analysis, open repair (odds ratio (OR) 4·92, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·55 to 17·00; P = 0·008), AT below 10·2 ml per kg per min (OR 6·35, 1·84 to 29·80; P = 0·007), anaemia (OR 3·27, 1·04 to 10·50; P = 0·041) and inducible cardiac ischaemia (OR 6·16, 1·48 to 23·07; P = 0·008) were associated with 30-day mortality. Anaemia, inducible cardiac ischaemia and peak V̇O2 less than 15 ml per kg per min (OR 8·59, 2·33 to 55·75; P = 0·005) were associated with 90-day mortality on multivariable analysis. Patients with two or more subthreshold CPET values were at increased risk of both 30- and 90-day mortality. Conclusion: An AT below 10·2 ml per kg per min, peak V̇O2 less than 15 ml per kg per min and at least two subthreshold CPET values identify patients at increased risk of early death following AAA repair.

Salinity of inland waters tends to increase with aridity, and biota of inland waters may have evolved greater salt tolerance in more arid regions. Here we compare the sensitivity of stream macroinvertebrate species to salinity from a relatively wet region in France (Lorraine and Brittany) to that in three relatively arid regions eastern Australia (Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania), South Africa (south-east of the Eastern Cape Province) and Israel using the identical experimental method in all locations. The species whose salinity tolerance was tested, were somewhat more salt tolerant in eastern Australia and South Africa than France, with those in Israel being intermediate. However, by far the greatest source of variation in species sensitivity was between taxonomic groups (Order and Class) and not between the regions. We used a Bayesian statistical model to estimate the species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for salinity in eastern Australia and France adjusting for the assemblages of species in these regions. The assemblage in France was slightly more salinity sensitive than that in eastern Australia. We therefore suggest that regional salinity sensitivity is therefore likely to depend most on the taxonomic composition of respective macroinvertebrate assemblages.

While there is a concerted effort to quantify uncertainty in risk assessments, the uncertainty due to intertest variability in species effect measurements is an overlooked component. The European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) guidance document suggests that multiple toxicity records for a given chemical–species combination should be aggregated by the geometric mean. Ignoring this issue or applying unjustified so-called harmonization methods weakens the defensibility of uncertainty quantification and interpretation about properties of ecological models, for example, the predicted no-effect concentration. In the present study, the authors propose a simple and broadly theoretically justifiable model to quantify intertest variability and analyze it using Bayesian methods. The value of data in ecotoxicity databases is maximized by using (interval-)censored data. An exploratory analysis is provided to support the model. The authors conclude, based on a large ecotoxicity database of acute effects to aquatic species, that the standard deviation of intertest variability is approximately a factor (or fold-difference) of 3.

The assessment is based on three components: hazard assessment, exposure assessment and risk characterisation. The latter is a combination of the former two. One standard approach is based on the deterministic comparison of exposure concentration estimates to the concentration of the toxicant below which adverse effects are unlikely to occur to the potentially exposed ecological assemblage. This concentration is known as the ‘predicted no effect concentration’ (PNEC). At the level of hazard assessment we are concerned with, there is a requirement that procedures be straightforward and efficient, as well as being transparent. The PNEC is in general currently determined using either a fixed assessment factor applied to a summary statistic of observed laboratory derived toxicity data, or as a percentile of a distribution over the ecological community sensitivity. Often it is the situation that a hazard assessment will be based on substantially small samples of data. In this thesis we evaluate proposals for determining a PNEC according to regulatory guidance and scientific literature. In particular, we explore these methods under the context of alternative probabilistic models. We also focus on the determination of conservative probabilistic estimators, which may be appropriate for this level of risk assessment. Additionally, we also discuss the detection of species non- exchangeability, a concept which is recognised by scientists and risk assessors, yet typically discounted in practice. A proposal on incorporating knowledge of a non-exchangeable species for probabilistic estimators is discussed and evaluated. The final topic of research examines a generalised deterministic estimator proposed in a recent European Food Safety Agency report. In particular, we analyse the robustness and analytical properties of some cases of this estimator which (at least) maintains the expected level of protection currently attributed. Proposals made within this thesis, many of which extend upon what is currently scientifically accepted, satisfy the requirements of being tractably straightforward to apply and are scientifically defensible. This will appeal to end users and increase the chances of gaining regulatory acceptance.

Aldenberg and Jaworska [2000. Uncertainty of the hazardous concentration and fraction affected for normal species sensitivity distributions. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 46, 1-18] proposed estimators that prescribed universal assessment factors which made use of distributional assumptions associated with species sensitivity distributions. In this paper we maintain those assumptions but introduce loss functions which punish over- and under-estimation. Furthermore, the final loss function is parameterised such that conservatism can be asymmetrically and non-linearly controlled which enables one to better represent the reality of risk assessment scenarios. We describe the loss functions and derive Bayes rules for each. We demonstrate the method by producing a table of universal factors that are independent of the substance being assessed and which can be combined with the toxicity data in order to estimate the HC5. Finally, through an example we illustrate the potential strength of the newly proposed estimators which rationally accounts for the costs of under- and over-estimation to choose an estimator; as opposed to arbitrarily choosing a one-sided lower confidence limit.","tags":null,"title":"On the application of loss functions in determining assessment factors for ecological risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1228780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1228780800,"objectID":"c858082a1102ad7f49012f6e9478fc51","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2008_rss/","publishdate":"2008-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2008_rss/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Estimating hazardous concentrations for environmental risk assessment with ecotoxicological effect data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hickey GL","Kefford BJ","Dunlop JE","Craig PS"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1225497600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1225497600,"objectID":"a7bf1d5fb3a643cca9d8c3e53fd2bed5","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2008-ssd/","publishdate":"2008-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2008-ssd/","section":"publication","summary":"Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) may accurately predict the proportion of species in a community that are at hazard from environmental contaminants only if they contain sensitivity data from a large sample of species representative of the mix of species present in the locality or habitat of interest. With current widely accepted ecotoxicological methods, however, this rarely occurs. Two recent suggestions address this problem. First, use rapid toxicity tests, which are less rigorous than conventional tests, to approximate experimentally the sensitivity of many species quickly and in approximate proportion to naturally occurring communities. Second, use expert judgements regarding the sensitivity of higher taxonomic groups (e.g., orders) and Bayesian statistical methods to construct SSDs that reflect the richness (or perceived importance) of these groups. Here, we describe and analyze several models from a Bayesian perspective to construct SSDs from data derived using rapid toxicity testing, combining both rapid test data and expert opinion. We compare these new models with two frequentist approaches, Kaplan-Meier and a log-normal distribution, using a large data set on the salinity sensitivity of freshwater macroinvertebrates from Victoria (Australia). The frequentist log-normal analysis produced a SSD that overestimated the hazard to species relative to the Kaplan-Meier and Bayesian analyses. Of the Bayesian analyses investigated, the introduction of a weighting factor to account for the richness (or importance) of taxonomic groups influenced the calculated hazard to species. Furthermore, Bayesian methods allowed us to determine credible intervals representing SSD uncertainty. We recommend that rapid tests, expert judgements, and novel Bayesian statistical methods be used so that SSDs reflect communities of organisms found in nature.","tags":null,"title":"Making species salinity sensitivity distributions reflective of naturally occurring communities: using rapid testing and Bayesian statistics","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1216252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1216252800,"objectID":"ecf9c10570b7fe29e0646a19342f35f6","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2008_ibc/","publishdate":"2008-07-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/talk/2008_ibc/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Assessment factors for non-exchangeable species","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hickey GL"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1149120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1149120000,"objectID":"571a86aa5d300eea25029a1b5fcaf1b4","permalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2006-dissertation/","publishdate":"2006-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.glhickey.com/publication/2006-dissertation/","section":"publication","summary":"The statistical linear calibration problem (or inverse linear regression problem) is the problem of determining a linear relationship between a set of observed data and their corresponding true values and then to be able to predict true values, based on future observed values. The problem is formulated and a variety of solutions are examined from both a frequentist approach and a Bayesian approach with more emphasis on the Bayesian approach. To illustrate the problem, an analysis of a recent archaeological problem, known as the luminescence problem, is examined.
