abstract = "Cardiac surgeons in the UK have openly published their outcome data at hospital and individual surgeon levels since 2005. Publication of these data has been associated with a decreased risk of inhospital mortality following cardiac surgery despite more high risk patients undergoing surgery. Cardiac surgeons in the UK have now developed a series of different tools with the aim of further improving transparency, facilitating access to clinical data and driving quality improvement. These tools make contemporary high quality data from the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit (NACSA) database available to various different interest groups. This article describes the tools that have been developed and details how they can be accessed."
