abstract = "Evidence-based medicine is the cornerstone of modern medicine. With increasing regulations from governments and insurance companies, the need to provide and continuously improve the quality of care is one of the duties of a physician practicing in the 21st century. Advances in our understanding of the human body and the technology we use to diagnose and treat patients has, through greater understanding, led us to an era in which we can no longer practice ‘what we believe in’ but have to practice based on evidence."
